# # Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART)

## Overview

The **Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART)** is an iterative method used to reconstruct an object or image from incomplete or noisy data, typically arising from computed tomography (CT) or other types of imaging modalities. ART is a part of the family of **iterative reconstruction algorithms**, which aim to improve the quality of reconstructed images over traditional techniques by minimizing errors across a series of projections.

The ART algorithm reconstructs an image by iteratively refining a guess based on algebraic methods. It uses the known projections at different angles to adjust the image in such a way that the simulated projections generated from the current image approximation match the actual projections as closely as possible.

## Features

- **Iterative Method**: ART iterates over a number of steps, gradually refining the reconstruction based on the input data.
- **Suitable for Sparse Data**: ART is particularly useful for situations where the data is incomplete, sparse, or noisy.
- **Versatile**: ART can be applied to many different types of imaging modalities, including medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and materials science.
- **Convergence Control**: The algorithm allows for controlled iteration and convergence, making it customizable for different applications.

## Algorithm

The ART algorithm can be described as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial estimate of the image (often a zero matrix or a uniform image).
2. **Projection Loop**: For each projection angle:
   - Simulate the projection of the current image estimate.
   - Compute the difference between the actual and simulated projections.
   - Update the image estimate by adjusting it in the direction of the projection error.
3. **Iteration**: Repeat the projection loop for a predefined number of iterations or until the reconstruction error converges to an acceptable level.

The algorithm proceeds iteratively, adjusting the pixel values (or voxel values in 3D) based on the difference between the measured projections and the projections computed from the current image estimate.

## Mathematical Formulation

Given a set of projections, the reconstruction process in ART is based on the following equation:

\[
Ax = b
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the system matrix representing the geometry of the imaging system.
- \( x \) is the vector representing the image or object to be reconstructed.
- \( b \) is the vector of measured projections.

The ART algorithm seeks to find the vector \( x \) by solving this system iteratively, updating the solution at each step.

## Prerequisites

To run ART, the following are required:

- **Python 3.x** or higher.
- **NumPy** for matrix manipulations and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization (optional, for displaying images and projections).
- **SciPy** (optional, for advanced optimization methods).

### Optional Libraries
- **scikit-image** for image processing tasks.
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for parallelized or GPU-accelerated computations (if working with large datasets).

## Installation

To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-image
